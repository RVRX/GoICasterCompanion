# GoIStreamToolRedux
A tool built to help Guns of Icarus tournament broadcasters easily manage team names, logos, maps, and timers in their overlay. 

This project aims to be a complete recreation of Urz's [original GoiStreamTool](https://urzlab.com/goistreamtool/). Note that none of GoIStreamTool**Redux**'s source comes from - nor was access ever gained to - the origional source code written by Urz.

## Input Example Files
All GoISTR releases so far require input files to base thier output off of, or the appliction will not work (often crash). Download an example input folder [here](http://skyborne.net/input.zip), or use the one that comes zipped with [Urz's download](https://urzlab.com/goistreamtool/GoiStreamTool_1.0.zip). This folder should be in the same directory as the GoISTR executable.
