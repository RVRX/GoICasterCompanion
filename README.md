# GoIStreamToolRedux
<p>GoIStreamToolRedux (GoISTR) is a cross-platform application designed to assist <a href="https://gunsoficarus.com/" target="_blank">Guns of Icarus</a> tournament broadcasters with their interfaces and overlays. It includes UI management for teams, maps, timers, and tournament info that all ties into an output folder, providing OBS (or other casting tool) with static file paths to read from. The GoISTR project started as an adaptation of the original closed-course Windows application <a href="https://urzlab.com/goistreamtool/">GoiStreamTool</a> by GoIO player and caster Urz.</p>
<p>GoISTR is a free and open-source software. As such, community contributions to the source or supporting material are welcome, and feedback is appreciated to help grow the application.</p>
