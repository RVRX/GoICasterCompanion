# GoIStreamToolRedux
A tool built to help Guns of Icarus tournament broadcasters easily manage team names, logos, maps, and timers in their overlay. 

This project aims to be a complete recreation of Urz's [original GoiStreamTool](https://urzlab.com/goistreamtool/). Note that none of GoIStreamTool**Redux**'s source comes from - nor was access ever gained to - the origional source code written by Urz.
